#  JavaScript Projects – Beginner to Intermediate

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects repository! 
This is where I’ve been practicing JavaScript by building small, hands-on projects. Each folder contains a complete mini project that helped me understand key concepts like:

- DOM manipulation
- Events and user input
- Conditionals and loops
- Working with APIs
- Real-world logic building

## What’s Inside?

Here’s a list of the projects I’ve worked on so far:

| [**Currency Converter**](https://currencyconverter-navy-eight.vercel.app/) | Converts currency using real-time exchange rates and displays country flags using an external API. |

| [**Tic Tac Toe**](https://tictactoe-xi-liart.vercel.app/) | A two-player game where X and O take turns until one wins or it’s a draw. Great for practicing game logic. |

| [**Rock Paper Scissor**](https://rockpaperscissor-dusky.vercel.app/) | A simple game to play against the computer — best of luck! Good practice for conditional logic. |

| [**Meme Generator**](https://memegenerator-pied.vercel.app/) | Generates random meme images with custom top and bottom text using a public meme API. |

| [**Age Calculator**](https://agecalculator-umber.vercel.app/) | Calculates your age based on your date of birth — helpful for working with dates and time. |

| [**Quote Generator**](https://quotegenerator-sandy.vercel.app/) | Displays random motivational quotes with each click — perfect for learning DOM manipulation and arrays. |
